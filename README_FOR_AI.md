# 🚨 AI SESSION QUICK START - READ THIS FIRST

> ⛔ **STOP!** Before doing ANYTHING, read this entire file. It's short.

## 📋 Session Handover (READ FIRST!)

**Read `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` immediately** - it contains:
- Current version and recent deployments
- What was worked on in recent sessions
- Known issues and in-progress items
- Database state and design decisions
- What NOT to change without asking

> **At END of every session:** Update SESSION_HANDOVER.md with what was accomplished in the session.

## What Is This App?

**Book Club Companion** is a **book club management tool** (NOT a personal tracker like Goodreads).

### Purpose & Vision

**Phase 1 (Current - Admin Tools):**
- Simplify the administrator's work to import, tag, and rate books
- Make book selection and scheduling easier
- Dashboard, Library, Search, Discussion Guides ✅ Built

**Phase 2 (Future - Member Features):**
- Members log in and see books on schedule
- Download discussion guides
- Add meetings to calendar
- Suggest books (saved as "Proposed")

**Phase 3 (Future - Full Admin):**
- Import/export functionality
- Set schedules
- Manage members (add, remove, align to clubs)
- Multi-book-club support
- Create/delete book clubs

### What This Is NOT
- ❌ NOT a personal book tracker (like Goodreads)
- ❌ NOT a reading journal
- ✅ IS a book CLUB management tool for GROUPS

## ⭐ The Three Golden Rules

### Golden Rule of Development
**Safety first. Small incremental changes. One thing at a time.**
- DEV = localhost:8080 (where you make and test changes)
- Make ONE small change
- Test it immediately on DEV
- Only then proceed to the next change
- Never make massive changes all at once
- Log significant changes in `CHANGELOG.md`

**Detailed best practices** (silent failure avoidance, no hardcoding, logging, etc.):
→ See `project_guidelines.md` "Development Protocols & Lessons Learned" section

### Golden Rule of Testing
**Human logs in, AI tests afterward. Localhost first, then promote.**
- **DATA SAFETY**: If a test involves changing data (Update, Delete, Create), use ONLY books with the status **'Test'**. Never modify production data (e.g., 'Scheduled', 'Saved' books) for testing.
- **AUDIT LOGS**: Maintain a session audit log for ALL data changes performed (as an artifact or in the walkthrough).
- **EXPLICIT CLEANUP**: Every test plan must include specific instructions for cleaning up test data at the end.
- Test on localhost FIRST
- Only push to TEST when localhost works
- User verifies TEST before production
- Never skip verification steps

### Golden Rule of Deployment
**DEV → TEST → PROD. Never skip a step. Always get approval.**
- DEV = localhost:8080 (local development)
- TEST = `test` branch pushed to GitHub (staging site)
- PROD = `main` branch pushed to GitHub (live site)
- Work on `test` branch, never `main`
- Get explicit user approval before PROD

---

## How We Work Together

**The Testing Golden Rule: Human logs in, AI tests afterward.**

- You CANNOT log in (you don't have credentials)
- You CANNOT navigate to new URLs (breaks session)
- You CAN click buttons, take screenshots, check console AFTER human logs in

### Agent-Assisted Testing Protocol
1. Ensure `node local_server.js` is running (check terminal or ask user)
2. Ask user: "Please open localhost:8080 and log in"
3. Wait for: "I am logged in"
4. Then YOU can: capture screenshots, click buttons, check console, navigate tabs
5. NEVER give up just because you can't log in yourself

## The 3 Environments (CRITICAL)

When user says... | They mean... | URL
------------------|--------------|----
**"localhost"** | Local dev server | `http://localhost:8080`
**"test"** | TEST branch/site | `book-club-companion-git-test-pam-rubins-projects.vercel.app`
**"prod"** or **"production"** | MAIN branch/live | `book-club-companion.vercel.app`

### The Flow: localhost → test → prod

```
[LOCALHOST]    →    [TEST]    →    [PROD]
  Develop           Verify         Deploy
  & test            on remote      to live
  locally           site
```

### Git Branches (IMPORTANT)
- **`main`** branch = PRODUCTION (live site) - **PROTECTED, never work here directly**
- **`test`** branch = Development branch (pushes to TEST site for verification)
- **ALWAYS work on `test` branch locally, NEVER on `main`**

### Deployment Workflow (MANDATORY)

**Step 0:** Run `git branch` to confirm you're on `test`
```bash
git checkout test   # If not already on test
```

**Step 1-2: Develop & Test LOCALLY First**
1. Make code changes locally
2. Test on localhost:8080 (ensure server is running!)
   - Repeat until localhost works correctly

**Step 3-5: When Localhost is Good → Push to TEST**
3. **⚠️ BUMP VERSION** (REQUIRED before ANY deployment):
   - Edit `js/app.js` line 3: `const APP_VERSION = 'X.X.X'`
   - Edit `package.json`: `"version": "X.X.X"`
4. Commit with version in message:
   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "v1.X.X: Description"
   ```
5. Push to TEST site:
   ```bash
   git push origin test
   ```

**Step 6: STOP AND WAIT**
- Tell user: "Deployed to TEST (v1.X.X). Please verify at [TEST URL]."
- TEST URL: `book-club-companion-git-test-pam-rubins-projects.vercel.app`
- User checks footer version matches
- Wait for user confirmation
- DO NOT proceed without explicit approval

**Step 7: Deploy to PROD (only after approval)**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge test
git push origin main
git checkout test   # Return to test for next work
```

> ⚠️ **If footer shows old version**, deployment failed. Debug before proceeding.

## The Planning Rule

**Before ANY code change:**
1. Understand the request
2. Identify affected files
3. Write a plan (or describe it)
4. Get user approval
5. THEN execute

**Massive changes = NEVER. Small incremental changes = ALWAYS.**

---

## Backup Before Major Changes

Before any large refactor:
1. Create: `Backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description/`
2. Copy: index.html, app.js, styles.css
3. Add README.md explaining purpose

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Zero Fabrication Rule
**NEVER make up:**
- Variable names (READ the code first)
- User IDs or passwords (ask human)
- Column names (check schema.sql)
- API endpoints (verify they exist)

### Code Hygiene
- View file AFTER editing to verify brackets match
- Include leading whitespace EXACTLY in edits
- Don't make 5 edits fixing your own typos

### CSS/UI Protocol
1. View current HTML structure FIRST
2. Check if Tailwind class exists (this project uses Tailwind)
3. Make ONE small change
4. Ask user to verify visually
5. Iterate

### Debugging Protocol
1. Check browser console for errors (ask user for screenshot)
2. Add ONE console.log at a time
3. Test IMMEDIATELY after each change
4. If stuck 3 times, STOP and ask user

---

## Token Efficiency

- **View only what you need** - Use line ranges, not entire 5000-line files
- **Don't re-read** - Remember what you've seen
- **Edit once, correctly** - Triple-check before editing
- **Brevity in communication** - Bullet points > paragraphs

---

## Stop Conditions

**STOP and ask the user if:**
1. You've tried the same approach 3 times
2. You're unsure what they meant
3. You're about to delete/overwrite something
4. You're about to change more than 50 lines
5. Human says "wait", "stop", "not yet"

**HOW to stop gracefully:**
- Finish current atomic operation (don't leave partial edits)
- Commit any completed work to avoid losing progress
- Summarize current state: "I've done X, Y is pending"
- Ask for direction before continuing

**DON'T keep trying. DON'T leave things half-done. ASK.**

## Architecture Quick Reference

```
project/
├── index.html        # Single-page app, all UI
├── js/app.js         # Large file (~4700 lines), main logic
├── css/styles.css    # Custom styles + Tailwind
├── api/gemini.js     # AI endpoint (serverless)
├── local_server.js   # Dev server proxy
├── schema.sql        # Database schema
└── *.md              # Documentation
```

**Key Info:**
- Current version: Check `js/app.js` line 3 for `APP_VERSION`
- Tailwind CSS (CDN, pinned to 3.4.1)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database
- Backend changes require server restart (`Ctrl+C` then `node local_server.js`)

---

## Git Protocol

- **Default branch:** `test` (for development)
- **Protected branch:** `main` (production only)
- Always run `git branch` before any git operation to confirm you're on `test`
- Project root: `/Users/pamrubin/Desktop/book-club/`
- Always use ABSOLUTE paths in tool calls

**Quick reference:**
```bash
git checkout test        # Switch to dev branch
git branch               # Verify current branch
git push origin test     # Deploy to TEST site
git checkout main && git merge test && git push origin main  # Deploy to PROD (after approval)
```

---

## First Message Requirement

At the START of every new conversation:
1. Read this file
2. Say: "I've read README_FOR_AI.md and understand the rules"
3. Ask: "What would you like to work on?"

DO NOT start coding until you've confirmed understanding.
